	<!-- Specifies which VMs are to be backuped and how. Supported sub-elements are:
	     - <vm>   : Single VM, does not matter on which ESXi host it is running
		  - <host> : All VMs on the specified ESXi hosts
		  ... both can be entered in any order but the first match wins.

		  Attributes are used to modify the behavior, following can be specified either
		  on sub-element or on the <backup> element. If sub-element does not have the 
		  attribute defined, the value is used from <backup> element. If that does not
		  have it defined the hardcoded default value is used:
	     - "delete_old_snapshots"  : 
		       If specified the utility will delete (only) our snapshots older than
				 this time. Our snapshots and time are recognized by the snapshot name.
				 Value is in seconds, but the number can end with 's' or 'm' or 'h' or
				 'd' to specify seconds, minutes, hours or days.

				 By default it is empty which means that no snapshots are deleted.
	     - "full_backup"  :
		       Do full backup for this VM. Boolean value - can be "true" or "false".
				 If not speficied it is "true".
	     - "only_running"  :
		       Only backup VMs that are running. Boolean value - can be "true" or "false".
				 If not speficied it is "false".

	     Following additional attributes can be defined on <vm> or <host> sub-elements,
		  but not on <backup> element.
		  - "replace_disks"  :
		       Coma separated disk positions, starting from 0, no space allowed.
				 The disk(s) matching the position(s) will not be copied and a new empty
				 virtual disk of the same size will be created and backuped instead.
				 Useful for saving space and not backuping datadisks which content is not
				 so important and that can be easily formated, attached and filled again.
		  - "type"  :
		       How the <vm> is localed by the name. Possible values are "name" or "regex".
				 By default it is "name" which means that the exact name must be specified.
				 If "regex" is used, the tag text is treated as regular expression. Usable
				 when we don't know the full VM name in advance.
				 Similar meaning for <host> sub-element.
